## How to use ?
The application has two input fields: the top one is for regular expressions (syntax highlighting is available), and the bottom one is large for test text. However, there is a **2500 character limit** for the application to work smoothly. The test text should not be too large when using a large input field, a toolbar is activated that provides the following options: full text clearing, loading text from the buffer, changing the highlight color of the match, and loading a text file.The top field is also rich in functionality. By clicking on the gear, you can select the necessary flags and also change the global search mode to 1 entry, also clear the text and view a list of all matches. The header contains a button for help with regular expressions and another menu button where you can read information about the application, view a list of saved regular expressions (you can also view it by swiping right to open a modal dialog), and exit.
